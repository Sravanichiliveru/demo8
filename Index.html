            What Is Paragraph Writing?
As we all know, a paragraph is a group of sentences that are connected and make absolute sense. While writing a long essay or letter, we break them into paragraphs for better understanding and to make a well-structured writing piece. Paragraph writing on any topic is not only about expressing your thoughts on the given topic, but it is also about framing ideas about the topic and making it convenient for the readers to follow it. In English paragraph writing, it is essential to focus on the writing style, i.e., the flow and connection between the sentences.

Therefore, a paragraph must be written in simple language in order to avoid any interruption while reading. In order to write a paragraph on any topic, you can refer to the samples given below and write a paragraph without any hindrance.

How to Write a Paragraph?
In order to determine how to write a paragraph, you will have to find a good topic and collect enough information regarding the topic. Once you find the supporting details, you can start framing the sentences, connect the sentences following a sequence, and find a perfect concluding sentence. To understand it better, we have provided a few paragraph writing examples for your reference.

Find a Topic Sentence: It is the first sentence which is an introduction to the given topic. It gives the main idea of what the paragraph would be about.
Supporting details: These are the details that can be collected from various sources. It comprises information related to the topic that gives strong support to the main topic.
Closing sentence: It is the last sentence that ends the paragraph and restates the whole idea of the paragraph. It is basically the concluding sentence that gives the basic idea of the whole topic.
Types of Paragraph Writing
It is essential to know the types of paragraph writing before you write about any given topic. Therefore, check the below information to understand the various types of paragraph writing.

Majorly, there are four types of paragraph writing, i.e., narrative, descriptive, expository, and persuasive.

Descriptive: This kind of writing basically describes the topic and appeals to the five senses.
Narrative: These kinds of writing are basically a narration of a story or a situation that includes a sequence.
Expository: These kinds of writing are a definition of something. These paragraphs require a lot of research.
Persuasive: These kinds of writing aim to make the audience admit a writer’s point of view. These are mostly used by the teachers to provide a strong argument.
Paragraph Writing Topics
A paragraph can be written on various topics. For example, a student of Class 1–3 would write a paragraph on topics like ‘A Cow’, ‘My School’, ‘My Mother’, etc. With classes, the topics may vary, and when writing for yourself, the topics can be anything that comes to your mind. Check the various paragraph writing topics provided below and refer to the paragraph writing samples for a better understanding of the writing style.

English Paragraph Writing Format
There is no specific format for writing a paragraph, as it is a narration of your own thoughts, ideas, and vision. Also, there are no restrictions to your writing. But a paragraph is called a well-written paragraph when this sequence is maintained — a topic sentence, then the description, and then the concluding statement.

Following the English paragraph writing format shall be helpful to the readers to understand your point of view.
